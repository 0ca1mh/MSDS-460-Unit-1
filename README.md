The Diet Problem Revisited (version 11)
Developed by Thomas W. Miller. Revised January 9, 2025.

Introduced by Stigler (1945) and discussed by Dantzig (1990), the diet problem is a classic problem in constrained optimization often used to introduce linear programming concepts. The diet problem has been studied extensively through the years (van Dooren 2018).
For this assignment, you need to construct a personalized diet using current recommended dietary allowances from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, updated to account for recent research on sodium intake and health (Mente, O'Donnell, and Yusuf 2021).
